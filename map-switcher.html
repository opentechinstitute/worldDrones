Countries below are sorted into three groups: those who possess unmanned drones, those who possess armed unmanned drones, and those who use these drones in combat.</p>
          <!-- <p>A countryâ€™s drone capabilities are classified according to the U.S. Air Force tier system. Tier I includes low altitude, long endurance drones like the Hermes 450; Tier II is comprised of medium altitude, long endurance drones like the Predator; and Tier II+ applies to high altitude, long endurance drones like the Global Hawk. Mini and micro drones are not classified in the tier system.</p> -->
